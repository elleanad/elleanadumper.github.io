<div class="headers">YOU'RE WELCOME CHATS: SPARKS</div>
            
            <div class="sparkint">
                <h1>
            You're Welcome provides a night away from the social norm, a 3-dimensional take on music art and culture. After a successful launch late last year we are back to bring you another all-star lineup showcasing some of the best talents our shores have to offer. A fresh batch of merchandise, live painting by Killafakejeastos Art and haircuts will be going down alongside dynamite local performances.    </h1>
                <div class="sparkpic"><img src="img/sparks.png"></div>
                <p>We had a chat to Auckland-based producer sparks before he brings the heat at You’re Welcome #2 tonight.  BYO fire hydrant, it's about to get lit.</p>
            <div>
                <h1>Enlighten us sparks, at what point did the idea of music-making ignite for you? </h1>
                <p>It’s cliché but true to say I’ve always loved music.  I only really realised it was something I could pursue when I was 15 and met the homies zaya and jamayne.  They exposed me to the underground scene on SoundCloud and the world of DJ/production.  We downloaded FL Studio 11 on the piss one day and remade Soulja Boy’s ‘Crank That’ with the stock sounds.  Making beats was all I could think about since.</p>
                <h1>Majority of modern music producers we listen to online simply operate out of their bedrooms, and as a small country, the NZ scene sort of culminates into one big region – so where is home for you?</h1>
                <p>Not going to lie but home for me is my bedroom… From my room in my hometown (Blenheim) to my room in the flat in Auckland.</p>
                <h1>It’s pretty evident that ‘sparks’ has become a name heavily imprinted into this developing NZ scene, producing tracks which have reached 800k SoundCloud streams.  Where did your stage name come from?</h1>
                <p>Around 2013, my first SoundCloud name was “YUNG FUCC BOII” haha… I only posted one song under that name before I heard “Sparkdala” by DJ Design, Madlib & Quasimoto.  I found the hook so humourous - it went “Ayo, I sparkdala, you sparkdala.  Everyday anyway yo, I sparkdala” and I became Sparkdala for like 6 months.  Wasn’t long after I shortened it to “sparks”. That shit stuck and grew on me.</p>
                <h1>SoundCloud is prevailed as the ultimate music discovery platform for producers to bend genres and experiment with sound with total freedom.  What or who has inspired the ‘sparks’ sound?</h1>
                <p>It’s so hard to pick out the main influences for my sound and the kind of ideas I have for my music, but I can definitely say there’s a very wide range.  To name a few, Kanye, Odd Future, Dilla, Lex, Hucci, Misogi, CARMACK!, and of course, Gravez, Yugi Boi and them!  I gotta give a lot of credit to zaya and gin$eng… even though we came out making some of the most ignorant and loudest trap shit I’ve heard.</p>
                <h1>Is there and artist or release you can’t get enough of at the moment?</h1>
                <p>At the moment I can’t get enough of Dilip, and I’ve been listening to a lot of Young Nudy, Gunna, Lil Baby and pretty much all the new rap shit out as well.  Besides that, I find myself constantly returning to American Football, anything Gambino, WOLF, Flower Boy, James Blake, Frank and most music I grew up listening to.  Shit’s nostalgic.</p>
                <h1>When you aren’t making music, what are you doing?</h1>
                <p>Doing ignorant shit with my friends and eating good.  But nah I just kick it, I’m studying at MAINZ at the moment so that's my main occupation.  I spend a lot of time finding pieces and building on my style.  I have always fucked with design, I love sitting on photoshop and letting my mind go crazy.</p>
                <h1>Favourite underground food joint?</h1>
                <p>I don’t have any, someone expose me to the scene.</p>
                <h1>Alongside your solo material, you’ve been involved with forceful collective Climate Change, recently performing at Tommy II-curated showcase in Wellington.  Has working within a group influenced yourself or your music-making in any way?</h1>
                <p>Hell yeah. The homie Zay and I learn so much off each other.  We both met BABE on SoundCloud and that man is deadass a genius. Tommy taught me the sauce, well at least the base, I had to learn those toppings myself (you feel me).  Shout out Sugoi too, the dude taught me how to be more pretty with it when It came to picking the right chords and synths. Snowee and Spydee crazy too, their kicks and bass are always so hard.</p>
                <h1>You’re Welcome #2… how excited are you to throw down? Are you feeling a little nervous?</h1>
                <p>No doubt. Should be stoooopid fun. </p>
                <h1>We’re burning to co-present this showcase with a stellar roster of rising underground acts - is there anyone you’re steaming to collaborate with on a release, locally or abroad?</h1>
                <p>zaya.  That’s the dream team - my homie jamayne as well.  I’m really focusing on Climate Change this year.</p>
                <h1>You’re Welcome will be providing some fresh threads on the night - when you want to dress to impress, what’s your go to outfit?</h1>
                <p>TI$A snapback, Lower singlet, my Hallensteins jeans with one leg bleached, $10 slip ons from the Warehouse and an Elmo backpack. You see me with that jerk swag?</p>
                <h1>What can we expect from sparks in 2018?</h1>
                <p>I think I might put out a tape this year… There will definitely be a lot of new music with artists from NZ and the US.  It’s been a little quiet for me over the last 2 months but I think I just needed time to reflect.  I’m coming in hot this year.</p>
